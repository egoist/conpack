## How does this look like?

```js
module.exports = config
  .entry('client')
    .add('./src/index.js')
    .end()
  .toConfig()
```

## Why

You may wonder why we need an abstraction of the webpack API, here's the reason:

> "Finally, webpack config done right. (...) Webpack clearly wants to stay low-level. So it makes total sense to outsource configuring it to well designed blocks instead of copy-paste."

> —— [Dan Abramov](https://github.com/gaearon) via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/806249934399881216)

But that is towards [webpack-blocks](https://github.com/andywer/webpack-blocks) which uses [webpack-merge](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack-merge) under the hood, but still, [webpack-merge has its downsides](https://github.com/andywer/webpack-blocks/issues/34):

- it's hard to update existing loaders
- it's hard to update existing plugins
- it's hard to update the options of exising loaders and plugins
- etc.

The solution definitely needs to be a higher level API than webpack-merge.

## Install

```bash
yarn add conpack --dev
```

## Usage

In your `webpack.config.js`:

```js
const config = require('conpack')

config
  .entry('client')
    .add('./src/index.js')
    .end() // You need to invoke `.end` to return to parent chain
  .output
    .filename('[name].js')
    .path(process.cwd())
    .end()
  .module
    .rule('compile:js')
      .test(/\.jsx?$/)
      .loader('babel', 'babel-loader', {
        presets: ['es2015']
      })
      .end()
    .end()

// you can lazy-change the loader by namespace `babel`
config
  .module
    .rule('compile:js')
      .loader('babel', 'babel-loader', {
        presets: ['latest']
      })
      .end()
    .end()

module.exports = config.toConfig()
```

For more usages please refer to [tests](/test), docs are coming soon.
